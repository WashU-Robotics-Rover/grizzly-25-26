# colcon defaults configuration
# Note: Platform-specific Python paths are handled automatically by CMakeLists.txt
# The grizzly_interfaces CMakeLists.txt automatically detects conda environments
# on macOS and sets Python paths accordingly.
#
# IMPORTANT FOR macOS CONDA ENVIRONMENTS:
# When switching between conda environments (e.g., ros_env vs ros_env_test),
# you may need to clean the build directory to clear CMake cache:
#
#   rm -rf build install log
#   colcon build
#
# The CMakeLists.txt will automatically detect the active conda environment
# via the CONDA_PREFIX environment variable and use the correct Python paths.
