# Layer Configuration for Grizzly Robotics Stack
#
# This configuration file defines the layer structure for node organization.
# Layers group related nodes together, allowing the system to manage them
# as units rather than individually. This prevents the system manager and
# lifecycle manager from becoming bloated as more nodes are added.
#
# Format:
#   layers:
#     layer_name:
#       nodes:
#         - node_name_1
#         - node_name_2
#       startup_order: 1  # Optional: order for startup sequence
#
# Usage:
#   - Add new nodes to existing layers by adding them to the nodes list
#   - Create new layers by adding new entries under layers
#   - The startup_order determines the order layers are configured during startup
#   - Lower numbers are configured first
