# Perception Node Configuration for Grizzly Robotics Stack
#
# This configuration file controls the test perception node behavior.
# The perception node is a lifecycle-managed node that can be enabled/disabled
# and activated/deactivated by the System Manager based on operational states.
#
# When to enable perception:
# - AUTONOMOUS mode: Perception is required for autonomous navigation
# - MANUAL mode: Perception may be enabled for operator assistance
# - STANDBY mode: Perception is typically disabled to save resources
#
# Usage:
#   - Set 'enabled: true' to allow the node to be activated
#   - Set 'enabled: false' to prevent the node from activating
#   - Adjust detection_rate_hz based on computational budget
#   - Adjust confidence_threshold to filter low-confidence detections

  ros__parameters:
    # Whether perception should be enabled (can be activated)
    # Set to false to completely disable perception functionality
    enabled: true
    
    # Detection processing rate in Hz
    # Higher rates provide more frequent updates but use more CPU
    # Typical values: 1-10 Hz for object detection, 20-30 Hz for tracking
    detection_rate_hz: 2.0
    
    # Minimum confidence threshold for detections (0.0 to 1.0)
    # Only detections with confidence >= this value are published
    # Lower values: more detections but more false positives
    # Higher values: fewer detections but higher quality
    confidence_threshold: 0.5
    
    # Maximum detection range in meters
    # Objects beyond this distance are ignored
    # Adjust based on sensor capabilities and mission requirements
    max_detection_range_m: 10.0
    
    # Sensor type identifier
    # Used for logging and potential sensor-specific processing
    # Common values: 'camera', 'lidar', 'radar', 'stereo', 'rgbd'
    sensor_type: 'camera'
